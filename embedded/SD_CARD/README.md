Source for operations with SD or MMC card using SPI interface.

Source is only for my educational and curiosity purposes, to investigate how to work with such kind of memory sorage devices.

It is were supposed that uC board is connected to PC via FT232RL chip.

PC is used for debug purposes to view which commands are sent to memory card and what answer is going out from memory card.

I succed to implement routines to communicate with memory card usind SD card standard datasheet,
but communication was very unstable.

Project and thus library is not finished.
